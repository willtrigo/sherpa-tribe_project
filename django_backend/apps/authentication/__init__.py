Authentication Application Module

This module handles authentication-related functionality including
user registration, login, logout, and token management for the
Enterprise Task Management System.

The authentication app provides:
- JWT-based authentication with access/refresh tokens
- User registration and profile management
- Session management
- Token validation and refresh mechanisms
- Integration with Django's built-in authentication system

Dependencies:
- Django REST Framework for API authentication
- djangorestframework-simplejwt for JWT token handling
- Custom user model from users app
