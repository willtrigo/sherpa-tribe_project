Workflow Management Module

This module provides comprehensive workflow automation, task routing, and business rule
processing capabilities for the enterprise task management system.

Core Components:
    - WorkflowEngine: Handles task state transitions and automation rules
    - RuleProcessor: Evaluates and executes business logic rule
    - TaskRouter: Manages automatic task assignment based on workload balancing
    - TemplateProcessor: Handles task template instantiation and variable substitution
    - EscalationManager: Manages SLA tracking and escalation procedures

Key Features:
    - Status transition validation with configurable workflows
    - Rule-based task assignment and routing
    - Template-driven task creation with dynamic variable substitution
    - SLA monitoring with automatic escalation workflows
    - Workload balancing algorithms for optimal task distribution
    - Critical path analysis for project dependency management
    - Business hours calculation for accurate time tracking
    - Webhook-based workflow event notifications

Architecture:
    The workflow system follows a modular, event-driven architecture where:
    - Events trigger workflow processors asynchronously via Celery
    - Rules are stored as JSON configurations for runtime flexibility
    - State machines ensure consistent task lifecycle management
    - Caching layers optimize rule evaluation performance
    - Audit trails track all workflow decisions and actions

Usage:
    >>> from apps.workflows import WorkflowEngine, RuleProcessor
    >>> engine = WorkflowEngine()
    >>> result = engine.process_task_transition(task_id=123, new_status='IN_PROGRESS')

    >>> processor = RuleProcessor()
    >>> assignments = processor.evaluate_assignment_rules(task_data)

Thread Safety:
    All workflow components are designed to be thread-safe and can handle
    concurrent execution in multi-worker environments. State mutations are
    protected by database transactions and Redis-based distributed locks.

Performance Considerations:
    - Rule evaluation is cached with configurable TTL
    - Bulk operations are used for batch task processing
    - Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
    - Lazy loading prevents unnecessary data fetching

Error Handling:
    All workflow operations implement comprehensive error handling with:
    - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
    - Fallback strategies for critical path operations
    - Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
    - Circuit breaker patterns for external service calls

Integration Points:
    - Celery for asynchronous workflow processing
    - Redis for caching and distributed coordination
    - PostgreSQL for persistent workflow state storage
    - Kafka for workflow event streaming (optional)
    - External webhook endpoints for notifications

Configuration:
    Workflow behavior is controlled via Django settings:
    - WORKFLOW_ENGINE_ENABLED: Enable/disable workflow processing
    - WORKFLOW_RULE_CACHE_TTL: Rule evaluation cache duration
    - WORKFLOW_MAX_RETRIES: Maximum retry attempts for failed operations
    - WORKFLOW_ESCALATION_HOURS: Default SLA escalation threshold
